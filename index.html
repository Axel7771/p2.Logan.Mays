<h4>Good:</h4>
<br>1-4 buttons have feedback allows you to know youâ€™ve clicked the button
<br>Simple and understandable design.
<br>Alarm and help are colored meaning they are emergency buttons.
<h4>Bad</h4>
No feedback when you press open door and close door. 
<br>All the buttons in one column, which can makes things looked jumbled up together.<br>
